# conda-recipes
Build recipes for various building different conda packages. Most of these
are uploaded to [my anaconda.org page](http://anaconda.org/rpmuller).
The pyquante2 build recipe can be found in
[the pyquante2 distribution directory](http://github.com/rpmuller/pyquante2/tree/master/conda-recipe).
